# Notes_statRethinking-

It is my notes for Dr. McElreath's class, rethinking statistics, my learning project, this one, starts in 26th, May, 2021, during my summer break. 

I learnt by myself via online video, slides, and the book he wrote. And I will also include my homework in this file. 

I am a non-English speaker, so in this note, you could find the mixture of English and Chinese, and I will try to take notes in both language as possible as I can. 


## Resources I used

The resources I was using all from Dr. McElreath's github, you could find slides and videos from his github, here is the link:
